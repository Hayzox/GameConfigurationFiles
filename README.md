## Introduction
This repository contains editable optimized game configuration files for popular online games to improve overall experience or performance.
These game configuration files are templates and should be changed to suit your personal preferences. 
Here are some examples and tips to help you polish your configuration file.

## Sensitivity, Keybinds & Resolution
Sensitivity, keybinds and resolution are the most personal setting in an online game, so there's no point copying those from pro gamers in the hope that they can do what they do.
Try to keep the same sensitivity, keybinds and resolution on all your games in order to maintain your muscle memory.
There are plenty of websites out there that can convert your sensitivity from one game to another, my favorite is [Mouse Sensitivity](https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com).

## FPS Capping 
Due to [mistiming](https://youtu.be/_73gFgNrYVQ), capping your frame rate to anything other than a multiple or a divider of your monitor's refresh rate will cause stuttering.
These are some of the FPS cap values that will prevent mistiming:
- 360 Hz: ... , 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360, 720, 1080, ...
- 280 Hz: ... , 40, 56, 70, 140, 280, 560, 840, 1120, ...
- 240 Hz: ... , 48, 60, 80, 120, 240, 480, 720, 960, ...
- 144 Hz: ... , 48, 72, 144, 288, 432, 576, 720, 864, 1008, ...
- 120 Hz: ... , 40, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480, 600, 720, 840, 960, 1080, ...
